   My journey in frontend development began recently, but it's been filled with exciting challenges, constant learning, and growth. I enjoy building clean, responsive UIs and exploring modern web technologies, performance optimization, and UX best practices every day.

When Iâ€™m not crafting user interfaces or diving into frontend performance, I enjoy exploring the Linux ecosystem â€” customizing my desktop and streamlining my workflow for speed and simplicity. Outside of tech, music helps me stay focused and creative.
